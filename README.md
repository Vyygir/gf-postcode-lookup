# Gravity Forms Postcode Lookup

This plugin is a Gravity Forms add-on that creates a postcode lookup field for UK addresses, using the [getaddress.io](https://getaddress.io)
API. To use this plugin, you'll need both an API key and an administrative key which can be generated through the getaddress.io website.

## Development

This has been specifically developed for one project, but I've open-sourced it and left the code here so that other people can use it if
they need to. I'll be actively updating the plugin for general fixes and security, but I won't be regularly adding new features.

If you'd like to suggest a feature then feel free to [create an issue](https://github.com/Vyygir/gf-postcode-lookup/issues/new) and I might
look into implementing it. Failing that, I'm more than happy to accept pull requests (written to a reasonable standard).

## Issues

I'm happy to fix any bugs or issues that arise if you happen to use the plugin. But please remember to submit the following details with
your issue to make my life easier when it comes to debugging:

- A link to your website (if applicable)
- WordPress version
- Gravity Forms version
- PHP version
- Any error messages/debug dumps, either thrown by my code, or dumped by yourself
